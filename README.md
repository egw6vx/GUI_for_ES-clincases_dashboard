# Graphical user interface (GUI) for a dashboard tool with simultaneous visualization of environmental surveillance and clinical case data 


## About

This GUI was created in order to help researchers develop their own COVID-19 dashboards for the simaltaneous display of 1) Environmental Surveillance viral load data for SARS-CoV-2 and 2) COVID-19 clinical case data. Development of a dashboard is often code-intensive and requires dedicated personnel, but this GUI provides a user-friendly interface for customizing dasboard design and uploading data. 


## User Instructions

Follow this [link](https://erin-wettstone.shinyapps.io/DashboardDesign_GUI/) to access the GUI. A screenshot of the interface is included below.

There are guided pop-up boxes to explain how to use the GUI for dashboard design. These basic instructions have also been outlined below:

1. Customize Excel framework for input of clinical case and ES data
2. Upload data sources
3. Select aesthetic preferences for the dashboard, including maps, data tables, and longitudinal plots
4. Preview dashboard and verify accuracy of data visualization
5. Download dashboard file for your use

## History

The dashboard that is output by this GUI is a reflection of the environmental surveillance dashboard linked here:
https://dhakaesforsars-cov-2.research.virginia.edu/ 

The Dhaka dashboard was created in order to relay our SARS-CoV-2 environmental surveillance and COVID-19 clinical case data from 52 collection sites and 21 wards in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is reported to the National Task Force in Bangladesh each week and allows our team to relay our results in real-time. Government and public health officials are able to view hots spots for COVID-19 incidence geographically and view trends in the data through color-coded tables and longitudinal plots.

After presenting this dashboard at international conferences and discussing it with research teams in Pakistan, India, and Nepal, it was clear that these teams desired a way to present their results to public health officials and government partners. However, some teams lacked the dedicated personnel to design a compute-intensive dashboard. This GUI serves as solution to the need for dedicated personnel, and instead allows research teams to design the dashboard themselves.

The backbone for the original ES dashboard in Dhaka is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This project would not be possible without our collaborators at icddrb, IEDCR, a2i, and Imperial College of London.
